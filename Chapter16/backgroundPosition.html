    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Magnolia</b> is a large genus of about 210 to 340[a] 
        flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family <i>Magnoliaceae</i>. 
        The natural range of <i>Magnolia</i> species is disjunct, 
        with a main center in east and southeast <b>Asia</b> and a secondary center in eastern North America, 
        Central America, the West Indies, and some species in South America.
    </p>
    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Ranunculus</b> is a large genus of about 1700 to more than 1800 species of flowering plants in the family <i>Ranunculaceae</i>. 
        Members of the genus are known as <b>buttercups</b>, spearworts and water crowfoots.
    </p>
    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Tulips</b> are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (<i>having bulbs as storage organs</i>) in the Tulipa genus. 
        Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). 
        They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. 
        Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation, 
        classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, 
        Liliaceae,[1] along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.
